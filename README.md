## Save Nine

A simple python script to take a small image and turn it into an enormous HTML file. Needs optimization.

## Code Example

See the example folder for what happens if you run `stitch.py -i morris.png -o morris.html` 

## Dependencies

Requires numpy and pillow. I'll make these actual dependencies soon.
